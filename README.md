# Sunlight-Tracking-Solar-Arduino
Arduino Based Automatic Sunlight Tracking Solar Panel System with LCD Monitoring


Case Study on Digital Design

A project intended to create a solar panel that could track the sunlight and move along the sun's direction.
With the use of photoresistors (LDRs) to measure the range of values between them, the system can determine what
axis the solar panel needs to rotate and the degree in angles needed. 
180 degree servo motors are used to rotate the panels.
